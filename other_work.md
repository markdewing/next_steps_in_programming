* [Lightweight Modular Staging](http://scala-lms.github.io/) (using Scala).  This looks like a very promising route for a generic programming framework that could implement the desired system.   It uses staged computation, which is a structured method for performing code generation.   Has anyone written any symbolic algebra code for expressions in the first stage?
* [Implicit Reference to Paramters (IRPF90)](http://irpf90.ups-tlse.fr/index.php?title=Main_Page) (using Fortran 90)
* Data flow
* Problem Solving Environments
* AST creation using Python
  * [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/)
  * [SEJITS](https://sejits.eecs.berkeley.edu/)
